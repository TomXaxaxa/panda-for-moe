Panda: Patched Attention for Nonlinear Dynamics

We will release trained checkpoints soon!

## Setup
Install the most up-to-date version of [dysts](https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts) for dynamical systems with `pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts`. Consider installing `numba` for faster numerical integration.

To setup, run:
```
$ pip install -e .
```

If training on AMD GPUs, install with the ROCm extras:
```
$ pip install -e .[rocm] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
```
